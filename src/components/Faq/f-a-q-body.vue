        <summary>WHY DO I HAVE TO INVEST IN CRYPTO CURRENCY</summary>
        <p>
          This is to the advantage of our investors, as most investors we have
          come from across the globe and wire transfers take 2-3 working days,
          are taxed heavily and bank charges are incurred. With cryptocurrency
          deposits, all these are handled as they are instant and have minimal
          charges and no taxation involved.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE MY DEPOSIT TO BE FUNDED</summary>
        <p>
          Depending on the deposit method, wire deposit usually takes between 3
          to 5 working days, depending on the sending bank while other methods
          take less. Cryptocurrency deposits are instant. Once we receive the
          funds in our bank account/wallet, they will be deposited into your
          trading account. Please contact TradeSyncPro, in case you have
          been charged with the deposit but funds are not showing in your
          trading account.
